				<h3>Motivation</h3>

				<br>
				<div class="paper-content">	
					<p>Trying to stop myself from eating takeaways all the time as they are sad little dinners that are full of fat and sugar and make you feel good only momentarily. Afterwards you usually feel sick and if I’m honest, a little depressed with yourself. That good feeling is all too fleeting. I resisted for years complaining that you couldn’t get restaurant quality food delivered, then Deliveroo arrived. But it’s even more expensive and it still cannot match up to the atmosphere and the presentation you get when it’s plated in a restaurant.</p>

					<p>My food planning was to buy good food items that I loved and to figure out what to eat during the week. With work pressures I’d always come home and go with my usual staples so that I ended up with strange odds and ends by the end of the week. So you know what happens, few items available in the fridge and tired from a work week, TGIF kicks in and the takeaway apps come out.</p>

					<p>My challenge to myself is to plan more carefully to reduce food waste and consider what amounts of food items I am actually going to need. Then think about what you’ll do when all your favourite items are used up.</p>
